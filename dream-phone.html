    <h1>Someone Please Make This Phone I'm Begging You</h1>
    <p>
        These are the simple things I want in a phone. It's basically a Sony Xperia phone frome 3 years ago with updated features and nothing stupid on top:
        <dl>
            <dt>Screen that isn't stupid huge</dt>
            <dd>4.5 to 5.5 inches</dd>
            <dd>16:9 or similar aspect ratio. Believe it or not I actually DO want to be able to reach the top of the screen</dd>
            <dd>120Hz refresh rate</dd>
            <dd>OLED or AMOLED</dd>
            <dd>1080p or somethin close. Nobody needs 4k. 720p is too little</dd>
            <dd>The display is flat</dd>
            
            <dt>Bezels that aren't stupid</dt>
            <dd>No, your hole-punch camera isn't cool. Put a small bezel on the top with the camera (one, not two or three) in it</dd>
            <dd>Oh look, there's a bezel in the top due to the camera. PUT THE SAME SIZED BEZEL ON THE BOTTOM. SYMMETRY, HAVE YOU HEARD OF IT</dd>
            <dd>Hot damn now you've got TWO BEZELS, now you can add TWO FRONT FACING SPEAKERS?? No way man unheard of</dd>
            <dd>Woweee that's so much space! Might as well add a nice little MULTICOLORED notification light</dd>

            <dt>Buttons that need to be on the sides of the phone include:</dt>
            <dd>Individual volume buttons</dd>
            <dd>Power button with built-in fingerprint scanner</dd>
            <dd>Extra button with two-stage press, for photos. ALSO REPROGRAMMABLE</dd>
            <dd>Notification slider (more optional than anything else in this stupid list)</dd>

            <dt>Ports</dt>
            <dd>3.5mm headphone jack (you can do it, I believe in you)</dd>
            <dd>USB-C</dd>
            <dd>Dual-Sim tray, but the 2nd sim slot can act as a micro SD card slot</dd>

            <dt>Cameras</dt>
            <dd>Main camera</dd>
            <dd>Ultrawide</dd>
            <dd>Telephoto</dd>
            <dd>That's it. THAT'S IT. STOP ADDING CAMERAS</dd>
            <dd>Cameras are FLUSH WITH THE BACK OF THE PHONE</dd>

            <dt>Various other features</dt>
            <dd>Wireless charging</dd>
            <dd>Best bluetooth that is available at the time</dd>
            <dd>At least a 4000 mAh battery with Sony's Power Sense or whatever</dd>
            <dd>Do like last year's processor or something idk. We actually don't need the fastest one anymore</dd>

            <dt>Body</dt>
            <dd>idk I'm not picky. Make it look like an old Xperia phone or something.</dd>
            <dd>Make it thick enough to house everything WITHOUT A CAMERA BUMP. USE THE EXTRA SPACE FOR BATTERY</dd>
            <dd>Glass or plastic back is fine as long as the sides are a metal of some kind.</dd>
            <dd>Front bezels need to be black.</dd>
            <br>
            That's it guys. For real. Really actually that's it. Not that hard. 
            In fact, I am 100% certain this would be cheaper to manufacturer than any other stupid "flagship" phone right now. Make it $1000, overpriced to hell, I'd still buy it.
            I'd like to ask for 3+ years of FEATURE updates, but I don't care that much anymore. I'd buy it if you never updated it again.
            XDA devs probably have my back and even if they don't I'm content being a securty risk to myself just to be able to use a phone that isn't a god damn tablet.
